        <h1>Ethics in IT: Cybersecurity</h1>
        <p>
          With the growing threat of cyberattacks such as malware, phishing, and DDOSing there is a need to increase
            cybersecurity measures. However, this comes with its own set ethics. For example, how much power should the
            government have when trying to ensure the safety of its citizens and institutions. The government must be
            able to strike a balance between security and personal liberties. This can be hard for democratic nations
            such as the U.S. whose Constitution is built on God given Rights. This is also true for institutions who hold
            personal data such as banks. They must be able to have a secure means of storing data while also making it
            accessible to themselves and its users. If too many security measures are set in place it compromises accessibility.
            When looking to the future it is important to keep these ideas in mind with the rising cyber threats.
